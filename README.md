This mini project aims to develop a Public Transportation Recommendation Management System that leverages data structures to provide optimal route and public transport recommendations based on the user's starting point and destination.
The primary goal of this project is to offer an efficient and comfortable travel experience using public transportation.
The system features five primary functions as follows:

1. **User Location Input Function**: This function allows users to input their starting location and desired destination.
2. **Route and Public Transport Determination Function**: This function identifies the nearest route and available public transport options for the user.
3. **Schedule and Availability Information Function**: This function provides users with information on the schedules and availability of public transport services.
4. **Alternative Route Provision Function**: This function suggests alternative routes to the user.
5. **Public Transport Data Management Function**: This function enables the addition, search, and deletion of public transport data.

Each function is designed to enhance the user experience by ensuring that they have access to accurate, timely, and comprehensive information to facilitate their travel using public transportation.

# How To Run
Open and run the file with '.cpp' extension in your code editor program.

# Notes
The system is designed to read from and write to existing text files.
This capability allows the system to maintain a dynamic and up-to-date database of public transport information.

By reading from text files, the system can retrieve current route details, schedules, and availability data.
Writing to text files enables the system to update this information as needed, ensuring that users always have access to the latest data.

Additionally, this functionality supports data management tasks such as adding new transport options, searching for specific routes or services, and deleting outdated or irrelevant information.
By leveraging text files for data storage, the system ensures flexibility and ease of data handling, making it a robust tool for efficient public transportation management.
